<p>Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren, emphasizing that victory involves more than just gameplay.</p>
<ul>
    <li>At 18, Gukesh became the youngest world champion in chess history after defeating Ding Liren with a score of 7.5-6.5.</li>
    <li>Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik criticized the quality of play during the championship match.</li>
    <li>Gukesh acknowledged the criticisms but stressed the importance of character and willpower in high-stakes matches.</li>
    <li>He recognized the pressure and unique demands of the championship but is proud of his performance at critical moments.</li>
    <li>Viswanathan Anand advised Gukesh to ignore the criticism, highlighting that it comes with every match.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well." - D Gukesh

<p>Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren, emphasizing that victory involves more than just gameplay.</p>
<ul>
    <li>At 18, Gukesh became the youngest world champion in chess history after defeating Ding Liren with a score of 7.5-6.5.</li>
    <li>Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik criticized the quality of play during the championship match.</li>
    <li>Gukesh acknowledged the criticisms but stressed the importance of character and willpower in high-stakes matches.</li>
    <li>He recognized the pressure and unique demands of the championship but is proud of his performance at critical moments.</li>
    <li>Viswanathan Anand advised Gukesh to ignore the criticism, highlighting that it comes with every match.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    "I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well." - D Gukesh
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, D Gukesh remains steadfast in his belief that the world championship victory is a testament to character and resilience, despite facing criticism from chess legends.</p>]]></description>

<p>The industry is abuzz with the phenomenal success of director Sukumar’s Pushpa 2: The Rule. The film, starring Allu Arjun, Rashmika Mandanna, and Fahadh Faasil, has shattered box office records since its debut.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pushpa 2 has earned Rs 762.1 crore net in India within nine days.</li>
    <li>The film's second Friday collections reached Rs 36.25 crore net.</li>
    <li>Overall collection includes Rs 27 crore in Hindi, Rs 7.5 crore in Telugu, and smaller amounts across other languages.</li>
    <li>The film has become the fastest Indian movie to cross the Rs 1,000 crore milestone worldwide.</li>
    <li>Its opening week total was Rs 725.8 crore, with a record-breaking Rs 164.25 crore on the opening day.</li>
    <li>Pushpa 2 is now eyeing the lifetime earnings of RRR, currently at Rs 782.2 crore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“The film has already earned Rs 1067 crore in its first week marking the highest first week gross ever in Indian cinema.”</blockquote>
<p>Despite its success, the film faced tragedy with a stampede at a premiere resulting in a death and injuries, leading to Allu Arjun's temporary arrest and subsequent bail.</p>
<p>The sequel, Pushpa 2, builds on the success of its predecessor and reunites its lead cast, contributing to its massive popularity and box office success.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Donald Trump claims government knows more about drone sightings than they are letting on (Timothy A. Clary/Pool Photo via AP, File)(AP)</figcaption>
<p>Donald Trump has raised concerns that the government is withholding information about recent mysterious drone sightings over the Northeast, demanding transparency and suggesting the objects should be shot down if they pose a threat.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trump claims government officials have more knowledge about drone sightings than is being disclosed.</li>
    <li>He stated that if the government is unaware of the flying objects, they should be shot down immediately.</li>
    <li>Concerns have increased among lawmakers regarding possible threats to U.S. airspace from foreign adversaries.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has denied any foreign country is responsible for the drone sightings.</li>
    <li>Other Republican lawmakers have echoed Trump’s call to take action against the drones.</li>
    <li>Drone sightings have been reported across several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Trump's remarks reflect growing bipartisan concern over unidentified drone activity within U.S. airspace, prompting calls for both government transparency and decisive military action if necessary.</p>]]></description>

<p>A defiant South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a second impeachment vote on December 14, 2024, due to his controversial attempt to impose martial law, which has led to significant political turmoil.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Yoon's martial law decree on December 3 was revoked within six hours after parliamentary resistance.</li>
    <li>The opposition plans to hold the impeachment vote at 4 p.m. local time on Saturday.</li>
    <li>Yoon's ruling People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote, leading to a lack of quorum.</li>
    <li>At least seven members of the People Power Party are expected to support the impeachment.</li>
    <li>The opposition controls 192 out of 300 parliamentary seats, needing at least eight PPP votes for a two-thirds majority.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>A Gallup Korea poll revealed two-thirds of Yoon's supporters oppose impeachment, while three-quarters of all respondents favor it.</blockquote>
<p>If impeached, Yoon would remain in office until the Constitutional Court decides on his removal, with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo acting as president in the meantime.</p>
<p>The political crisis has raised concerns about South Korea's stability and economic reputation, amid rising public discontent and opposition to Yoon's presidency.</p>]]></description>

<p>The article discusses Sunil Gavaskar's reaction to the booing of Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj by the Australian crowd during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, following a clash between Siraj and Australian batsman Travis Head.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Siraj was booed after a fiery send-off to Travis Head, who was dismissed for 140 runs.</li>
    <li>Sunil Gavaskar criticized the Australian crowd's hypocrisy, noting that fast bowlers are naturally aggressive.</li>
    <li>The altercation added to the series' excitement, but generated controversy regarding crowd behavior.</li>
    <li>Gavaskar suggested that Aussies should embrace their aggressive nature rather than act holier-than-thou when abroad.</li>
    <li>He commented on the changing nature of cricket and the reduction of uncouth behavior in the sport, while still acknowledging the intensity of competition.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    "Siraj is getting the stick from all the “saints” in Australian cricket who, of course, were known for their impeccable behaviour on the field." - Sunil Gavaskar
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, Gavaskar's remarks highlight the tension between crowd expectations and the aggressive nature of competitive sports, urging Australian fans to embrace their historical reputation while recognizing the evolving dynamics of the game.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>A male patient with ZNF308 mutation referred at month 11 for “retinopathy of prematurity” given the premature labor and avascular retina in both eyes.</figcaption>

<p>A confirmed diagnosis of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) greatly improves patient management. This article discusses the importance of accurate diagnosis, the challenges faced, and the role of genetic testing in differentiating FEVR from similar retinal diseases.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is an inherited retinal disease affecting blood vessel formation in the retina.</li>
    <li>Symptoms range from mild visual deficits to blindness, often misdiagnosed as other conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).</li>
    <li>A study of 104 pediatric patients revealed that 60% initially misdiagnosed with FEVR actually had different conditions.</li>
    <li>Genetic testing is crucial for confirming FEVR diagnoses and tailoring appropriate treatments.</li>
    <li>Conditions frequently misdiagnosed as FEVR include ROP, PFV, and Coats disease, with specific distinguishing features.</li>
    <li>Regular monitoring and follow-up in patients with confirmed FEVR are necessary to detect disease progression.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    “Given the high rate of initial misdiagnoses, ophthalmologists should consider incorporating genetic testing into their diagnostic workflows for pediatric retinal disorders.”
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, incorporating genetic testing into the diagnosis of FEVR can significantly enhance patient outcomes by preventing misdiagnosis and enabling targeted treatment strategies.</p>]]></description>

    <li>Intermittent fasting is known for potential health benefits, including weight loss and reduced inflammation.</li>
    <li>Recent findings reveal that intermittent fasting could negatively impact hair growth.</li>
    <li>The study utilized both mouse models and a small human trial to assess hair growth rates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>“The human population is very heterogeneous, so the effects might be different for different people.” — Bing Zang, PhD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study observed that mice on an intermittent fasting regimen showed only partial hair regrowth after 90 days, while a control group regrew most of its hair in 30 days. In a small trial with young adults, hair growth speed was reduced by 18% for those fasting 18 hours daily.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“We don’t want to scare people away from practicing intermittent fasting… it’s just important to be aware that it might have some unintended effects.” — Bing Zang, PhD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This research underscores the need for awareness of potential side effects associated with intermittent fasting, particularly for those concerned about hair health. Further studies are planned to explore how fasting impacts hair growth mechanisms and other tissues.</p>]]></description>

<figcaption>Luigi Mangione is led into the Blair County Courthouse for an extradition hearing on Tuesday in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania.</figcaption>
<p>The article discusses the ongoing case against Luigi Mangione, who has been charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Despite the seriousness of the crime, the most serious charge he faces is second-degree murder. Legal experts suggest the charges could escalate depending on the evidence uncovered.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of killing Brian Thompson in broad daylight on December 4.</li>
    <li>Evidence includes a 3D-printed gun and fake ID matching shell casings from the crime scene.</li>
    <li>Mangione has expressed intentions to fight extradition to New York, where he faces five charges, including second-degree murder.</li>
    <li>If prosecutors can prove intent to commit terrorism, charges could potentially be upgraded to first-degree murder.</li>
    <li>Under New York law, second-degree murder carries a sentence of 15 years to life, while first-degree murder has a minimum of 20 years to life.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    “Terrorism is defined, basically, as creating, intimidating the civilian population or influencing a government unit to act in a certain way.” - David Shapiro, legal expert
</blockquote>
<p>The case has raised concerns regarding safety in corporate America, as others fear potential copycat incidents due to rising tensions towards the health care industry. With this high-profile case, the process of extradition is anticipated to move quickly as officials aim to bring Mangione to justice in New York.</p>]]></description>
