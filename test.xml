<p>Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has criticized the Congress party for its inconsistent stance on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), suggesting that they cannot accept results they like and blame the EVMs for defeats.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abdullah rebukes Congress for questioning EVMs after losing elections.</li>
  <li>He argues that parties should be consistent in their trust of the voting mechanism.</li>
  <li>Abdullah believes the Congress should have not relied solely on the National Conference during the recent campaign.</li>
  <li>He emphasizes the need for clarity and principle in political discourse.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"When you get a hundred plus members of Parliament using the same EVMs... you can't then... say we don't like these EVMs because now the election results aren't going the way we would like them to." - Omar Abdullah</blockquote>
<p>Abdullah emphasizes that electoral machines remain the same regardless of the outcomes and cautions against using them as excuses for electoral failure.</p>
<p>His remarks come amidst ongoing tensions between the National Conference and the Congress in the context of their alliance under the INDIA Bloc.</p>]]></description>

<p>French economist Thomas Piketty emphasized the need for India to implement higher taxes on its wealthiest individuals to combat rising inequality, proposing a 2% wealth tax and a 33% inheritance tax during a recent conference.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Piketty advocates for a 2% wealth tax on those with assets exceeding 100 million rupees ($1.18 million).</li>
  <li>A 33% inheritance tax on properties valued at least 100 million rupees is suggested to ensure equitable distribution.</li>
  <li>He argues these measures could generate revenue equivalent to 2.73% of India's GDP.</li>
  <li>Piketty highlighted that 1% of Indians now control a disproportionate share of national income.</li>
  <li>Current Indian government policies have favored wealth retention and growth without reintroducing wealth or inheritance taxes after their removal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>“India should be active in taxing the rich,” - Thomas Piketty</blockquote>
<p>Despite support for wealth taxation from some economists, others, such as V. Anantha Nageswaran, caution against potential economic outflows that could result from increased taxation.</p>]]></description>
